Hello World!!

So I have started a blog! My intention is to have a place to post updates on projects, industry news, and other random thoughts that are too long for a tweet. Some of the projects I am working on is a children’s book that teaches programming concepts through songs that children already know. I am also working on a game that teaches kids how credit cards work. It’s like a cozy farming sim with credit card bills. I also plan on jumping into At Proto development. 

Who am I? My name is Kelly Syp. I am a Senior Programmer Analyst with a specialty in electronic payments and e-commerce. Basically I make sure credit cards work in stores and online. Did I want to be a credit card expert when I was a kid? No, I wanted to be a zoo keeper and be friends with monkeys. But it’s a niche that I’ve found that I really enjoy. I love learning about the technology and also the standards that keep people’s information safe. I feel that working in payments has the most intimate relation with customers because they are trusting you with the data from their own pocket.
